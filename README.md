# Machine Learning Demonstration
A display of various data  techniques applied to an example dataset of penguin sampled at the Palmer Archipelago


# About the Dataset

The Palmer Island Penguin Dataset contains information about size measurements and isotope concentrations for  penguins observed in the Palmer Archipelago of Antartica [^1]

It is a great dataset for demonstrating machine learning methods, with both continuous and discrete variables that can be used to predict penguin species using multiclass classification methods.

This repository contains example Python code to explore this dataset, including
- supervised machine learning models
    - random forrest regression
    - vanilla neural networks
- unsupervised ML methods
    - cluster analysis
    - dimensionality reduction techniques
